Inherit from built-in types
Classes can also inherit from built-in types this means inherits from any built-in and take
advantage of all the functionality found there.

In below example we are inheriting from dictionary but then we are implementing one of its  method
    setitem__.  This  (setitem)  is  invoked  when  we  set  key  and  value  in  the
dictionary. As this is a magic method, this will be called implicitly.

dd['a'] = 10
dd['b'] = 20

"""
Letâ€™s  extend  our  previous  example,  below  we  have  called  two  magic  methods  called
    getitem     and     setitem     better invoked when we deal with list index.
